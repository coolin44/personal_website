-A python program to find different graph theory metrics of a given graph in matrix form.

-Uses NumPy and SciPy to find the: Order, Size, Maximum Degree, Minimum Degree, Degree Sequence, Vertex Eccentricity, Radius, Diameter, Domination Number, Total Domination Number, Independence Number, and Clique Number of a given graph in matrix form.

-Handles any graph with 2 < N < 100,000 vertices.

-Code available on GitHub repository.
